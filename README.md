This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple data fetching app . I used public randomuser.me API to fetch some data for my app. It is been designed as a recruitment task for Monogo company based in Lublin. I aim to develop my skills in the field of front-end development. I am also interested in getting some more exp in manual/automatic testing of applications.
